# Release Coordination

This chapter provides an overview of all release related information. 

The [maintenance](maintenance.md) page documents the relation between the development branches and the major community and product versions. Finally there's a table which lists all HAL releases with links to the relevant tags, issues and [release notes](release-notes.md). 

The HAL management console can be accessed in different ways. The [distribution](distribution.md) page describes the different models.
