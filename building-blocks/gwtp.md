# Framework / MVP

The console builds on the [GWTP framework][1] and inherits most it's features and framework services. Most notable are the MVP design pattern and dependency injection using Gin: These two along with the GWTP Placemanager create the foundation for loading, initialising and rendering dialogs.

If you are not familiar with the GWTP framework, it is strongly advised to make yourself familiar with it before getting your hands on the code.

Building blocks you should be familiar with before you get going:

- PlaceManager
- Presenter Lifecycle
- Gatekeeper
- The MVP Pattern
